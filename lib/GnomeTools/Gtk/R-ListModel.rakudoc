=TITLE GnomeTools::Gtk::R-ListModel
=head1 Description

Role to be used for classes such as B<GnomeTools::Gtk::ListView>. Its purpose is to register and process events. The role is also used to add, find and remove items from the list in the model.

For simple use, use C<.set-events()>. For more elaborate widgets for each list entry use one or more methods C<.set-setup()>, C<.set-bind()>, C<.set-unbind()>, and  C<.set-teardown()>.

=head1 Methods

=comment -----------------------------------------------------------------------
=head2 set-events

Register a series of events. One defined in B<Gnome::Gtk4::ListView> and the rest from B<Gnome::Gtk4::SignalListItemFactory> class. The purpose of this method is to register a series of events at once without the need of user method to capture the events. The lists of the classes using this role are populated with B<Gnome::Gtk4::Label>s. The label entries are set with the user text from C<.append()>.

=begin code
method set-events ( )
=end code

=comment -----------------------------------------------------------------------
=head2 


=item $object; User object where methods are defined to process the events. Most events are defined by B<Gnome::Gtk4::SignalListItemFactory>. The info can be looked up L<here|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/SignalListItemFactory> or L<here|/content-docs/GnomeTools/reference/Gtk/R-ListModel>.
  The method is not called when it isn't defined.
=item *%options: Any user options. The options is given to the method in C<$object>.

The event defined in B<nome::Gtk4::ListView> is C<activate> and the method called will be C<activate-list-item>. The C<activate> event is emitted when a row has been activated by the user. If an item is activatable, double-clicking on the item, using the Return key or calling C<.activate() in Gnome::Gtk4::Widget> will activate the item. Activating instructs the containing view to handle activation.

=head2 Events

When an event fires, user methods are called when they are defined. The user must provide an object where these methods are defined. There are many events, so the method names are fixed for simplicity. The call to be used is C<.set-events()> defined in the classes using this role.

=head2 Selection type events.

=head3 selection-changed

The C<selection-changed> event is emitted when the selection state of some of the items in the model changes. Note that this signal does not specify the new selection state of the items, they need to be queried manually. It is also not necessary for a model to change the selection state of any of the items in the selection model, though it would be rather useless to emit such a signal.

The user method must be named C<selection-changed> and its API must be

=begin code
method selection-changed ( UInt $position, @selections, *%options )
=end code

=item $position is the position of the last clicked selection
=item @selections is the selection of items used to add items to the list.
=item %options. Any named arguments C<.new()> are given to the method.



=head2 Signal factory type events.

=head3 setup

The C<setup> event is emitted to set up permanent things on the B<Gnome::Gtk4::ListItem>. However, the list item is kept under the hood of this class. So, this means the called routine only needs to create and return the widget used in the row.

The user method must be named C<setup-list-item> and its API must be

=begin code
method setup-list-item ( *%options --> Gnome::Gtk4::Widget )
=end code
=item %options. Any named arguments C<.new()> are given to the method.



=item2 Method bind-list-item; Handles the C<bind> event. The event is emitted to bind the widgets created by C<.setup-list-item()> to their values and, optionally, add entry specific widgets to the given widget. Signals are connected to listen to changes - both to changes in the item to update the widgets or to changes in the widgets to update the item. After this signal has been called, the listitem may be shown in a list widget. The C<$item> is the string inserted in the list using e.g. C<.append()>. Any named arguments in C<*%options> given to C<.new()> are given to the method.

=begin code
method bind-list-item ( Gnome::Gtk4::Widget $widget, Str $item, *%options )
=end code

=item2 Method unbind-list-item; Handles the C<unbind> event. The event is emitted to undo everything done when binding. Usually this means disconnecting signal handlers or removing non-permanent widgets. Once this signal has been called, the listitem will no longer be used in a list widget.
  The C<bind> and C<unbind> events may be emitted multiple times again to bind the listitem for use with new items. By reusing listitems, potentially costly setup can be avoided. However, it means code needs to make sure to properly clean up the listitem when unbinding so that no information from the previous use leaks into the next one. Any named arguments in C<*%options> given to C<.new()> are given to the method.

=begin code
method unbind-list-item ( Gnome::Gtk4::Widget $widget, Str $item, *%options )
=end code

=item2 Method teardown-list-item; Handles the C<teardown> event. The event is emitted to undo the effects of the C<setup> event. After this signal was emitted on a listitem, the listitem will be destroyed and not be used again. No C<$item> is provided because the item is already destroyed. Any named arguments in C<*%options> given to C<.new()> are given to the method.

=begin code
method teardown-list-item ( Gnome::Gtk4::Widget $widget, *%options )
=end code




=head2 get-selection

Get the current selection.

=begin code
method get-selection ( Bool :$rows = False --> List )
=end code

=item $rows: By default a list of items are returned. When row numbers are needed set the variable to True.



=head2 append

Add an item at the end of the list

=begin code
method append ( *@list-item )
=end code

=item @list-item: Items to append. Items must be of C<Str> type



=head2 find

Gets the position of the item in the list. The return value can be undefined.

=begin code
method find ( Str $list-item --> UInt )
=end code

=item $list-item: The item to find.



=head2 get-string

Gets the item at C<$pos> of the item in the list. The return value can be undefined.

=begin code
method get-string ( UInt $pos --> Str )
=end code

=item $pos: The item at the position.



=head2 remove

Remove the item at C<$pos> of the item in the list.

=begin code
method remove ( UInt $pos )
=end code

=item $pos: The item at the position.

=head3 An example to remove selected items

=begin code
# Reverse rows because after each removal the row count decreases
# This causes to remove wrong rows or throwing errors like:
# (process:8769): Gtk-CRITICAL **: 18:25:48.324: gtk_string_list_splice:
# assertion 'position + n_removals <= objects_get_size (&self->items)'
# failed.
# The error shows that under the hood, splice() is used

my @selections = $listview.get-selection(:rows).reverse;
for @selections -> $selection {
  $listview.remove($selection);
}
=end code

=head2 splice

Remove and/or insert items at position given by C<$pos>.

=begin code
method splice ( UInt $pos, UInt $nremove, @str-array )
=end code

=item $pos: The item at the position.
=item $nremove: Number of rows to remove at $pos.
=item @str-array: The array of items to insert at $pos after removal.
